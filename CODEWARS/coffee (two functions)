Andy LOVES coffee, he's totally addicted. Unfortunately he drinks too much so the doctor has advised he only drinks 6 espresso shots a day.

Andy only drinks one type of coffee a day, and each have the following number of espresso shots in them:

espresso = 1 shot

double espresso = 2 shots

flat white = 2 shots

latte = 1 shot

mocha = 2 shots

decaf = 0 shot

Challenge:

Create a function that returns the following:

If Andy has consumed no shots return "You haven't even had coffee today!"

If Andy has had less than 4 shots return "The doctor won't be worried yet!"

If Andy has had 4 shots return "You can have 2 more shots then no more!"

If Andy has had 5 shots return "You can only have an espresso, latte or a decaf now"

If Andy has had 6 or more shots return "Only decaf for you now!"

    break;

    break;
